//Objective: Write a program that prompts the user for an amount due, an amount received, and outputs the change given in dollar,
// quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.

#include<iostream>

using namespace std;

int main(){
  double due;
  double received;
  cout <<"Amount due: $";
  cin>> due;
  cout<<"Amount received:$";
  cin>> received;
  
  double change = received - due;
  //example change = 4.32
  //dollars=4, quarters=1, dimes=0, nickels=1, pennies=2;
  
  int dollar = change;//dollar =4
  change = change-dollar; //change = 0.32;
  int coins = change * 100; //coins = 32
  int q = coins / 25;
  coins = coins-25*q; // coins = 7
  int d = coins / 10; // d = 0
  coins = coins-10*d;
  int n = coins/5; //n = 1
  coins = coins-5*n;
  int p = coins/1; //p=2
  coins = coins-1*p;
  
  cout<<"dollar"<<dollar<<endl;
  cout<<"quarters"<<q<<endl;
  cout<<"dimes"<<d<<endl;
  cout<<"nickels"<<n<<endl;
  cout<<"pennies"<<p<<endl;
