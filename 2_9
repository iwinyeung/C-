//Objective: Write a program that prompts the user for an amount due, an amount received, and outputs the change given in dollar,
// quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.

#include<iostream>
#include<cmath>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	double due;
	double received;
	cout << "Amount due: $";
	cin >> due;
	cout << "Amount received:$";
	cin >> received;

	double change = received - due;


	int dollar = change; 
	change = change - dollar; 
	int coins = round(change * 100); 
	int tw = coins / 25;
	coins = coins - 25 * tw;
	int t = coins / 10; 
	coins = coins - 10 * t;
	int f = coins / 5; 
	coins = coins - (5 * f);
	int o = coins;
	coins = coins - o;
	

	cout << "dollars : " << dollar << endl;
	cout << "quarters: " << tw << endl;
	cout << "dimes: " << t << endl;
	cout << "nickels: " << f << endl;
	cout << "pennies: " << o << endl;

	return 0;
