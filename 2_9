//Objective: Write a program that prompts the user for an amount due, an amount received, and outputs the change given in dollar,
// quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.

#include<iostream>
#include<cmath>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    double due;
    double received;
    cout << "Amount due: $";
    cin >> due;
    cout << "Amount received:$";
    cin >> received;
    
    double change = received - due;
    
    int dollar = change;//dollar =4
    change = change - dollar; //change = 0.32;
    int coins = round(change * 100); //coins = 32
    cout << coins << endl;
    int q = coins / 25;
    coins = coins - 25 * q; // coins = 7
    int d = coins / 10; // d = 0
    coins = coins - 10 * d;
    int n = coins / 5; //n = 1
    coins = coins - (5 * n);
    int p = coins;
    
    
    cout << "dollar: " << dollar << endl;
    cout << "quarters: " << q << endl;
    cout << "dimes: " << d << endl;
    cout << "nickels: " << n << endl;
    cout << "pennies: " << p << endl;
    
    return 0;
