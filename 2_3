Objective: Write a program that prompts the user for two integers and then prints: sum, difference, product, average, distance, maximum, and minimum

#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
cout<<"Enter the first integer:" ;
int y; 
cin >> y;


cout << "Enter the second integer:" ;
int z;
cin >> z;

cout <<"their sum is:"<< y + z<<"\n";
cout << "their difference is:" << y - z<<"\n";
cout << "their product is:" << abs(y - z) << "\n";
cout << "their average is:" << (y+z)/2 << "\n";
cout << "their distance is:" << abs(y - z) << "\n";
cout << "their maximum is:" << max(y,z) << "\n";
cout << "their minimum is:" << min(y,z) << "\n";
