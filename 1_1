Objective: Write a program that prints an introduction, asks for user input, and returns the message "I am sorry, I cannot do that."

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	std::cout << "Hello, my name is Hal!\n";
	std::cout << "What would you like to do today?\n";
	string user_input;
	getline(cin, user_input);
	std::cout << "I am sorry, I cannot do that.\n";
	return 0;
}
